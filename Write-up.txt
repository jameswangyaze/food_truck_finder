Overall, this is a fun little project. I really enjoyed the fact that there are so many different ways to parse the JSON data and each way has its own technical challenge.
If I had more time or this is a production page, I would add a feature where the user can visualize all the food trucks on a google map plug in on the website. And the user can click on each truck icon on the map to learn more about the details. Also a better filter/pagination mechanism through some fancier JavaScript framework would be nice. Maybe also add some time picker so that the user can see what's open for dinner around 7 p.m.
The difference between a command-line program and a web application is that web application has a UI and better separation of the MVC layer, which not only enhances the UX also makes the code easier to maintain and debug.
